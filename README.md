## What's mwat?
mwat is a command line tool to perform an easy way to translate the HTML view for a web app.

# What?
I know, it isn't easy to understand and for me, it isn't easy to explain.
I restart with an example.

# Preamble
I like to develop web apps. The web technologies are very attractive, easy to understand and use.
I have found a boring point about these technologies: the translation.
There are a lot of js libraries to permit the translations, but i don't like them: they aren't intuitive (easy to use) and the result user experience isn't good (loading...).

# The example
